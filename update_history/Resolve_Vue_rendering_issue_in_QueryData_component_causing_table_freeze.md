## Problem

When clicking on database tables with data in the Query Data interface, the EasyDataTable component would fail to render and cause Vue errors, freezing the entire interface. Users reported that after importing XML data successfully, clicking on populated tables (like `fpr_db`) would show the table header but no data, accompanied by console errors:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'shapeFlag')
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by problematic template slot configurations in the EasyDataTable component. The custom template slots for `item-element_item` and `item-component_name` were creating Vue rendering conflicts that prevented the table from properly displaying data.

## Solution

Removed the problematic template slots that were causing the Vue shapeFlag errors while preserving all core functionality:

- **Before**: Complex template slots causing rendering conflicts
- **After**: Clean EasyDataTable configuration with proper empty state handling

## Changes Made

1. **Simplified EasyDataTable template** by removing custom item slots that were causing Vue rendering issues
2. **Preserved empty state messaging** with conditional display for tables without data
3. **Maintained all existing functionality** including search, pagination, and table selection
4. **Cleaned up debug logging** from the data fetching process

## Testing

- ✅ Tables with data display correctly (verified with `fpr_db` containing 2 items)
- ✅ Tables without data show appropriate empty state messages
- ✅ No more Vue console errors or interface freezing
- ✅ All table navigation, search, and pagination work as expected
- ✅ Backend API integration remains unchanged and functional

**Before (Broken):**
![Issue - Table selected but no data displayed, interface frozen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fcf09d5-6586-4398-852f-2ba9c1b43439)

**After (Fixed):**
![Working - Table data displays correctly with full functionality](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/178236b8-969b-427d-a773-c95d4eccc7f8)

The fix resolves the critical rendering issue while maintaining all existing functionality, allowing users to successfully query and view database table contents without encountering freezing bugs.
