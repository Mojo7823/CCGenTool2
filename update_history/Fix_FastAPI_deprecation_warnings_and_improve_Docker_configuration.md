## Overview

This PR addresses code quality issues and verifies the full functionality of the CCGenTool2 application. After thorough testing of both frontend and backend components, I identified and fixed several deprecation warnings and configuration issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. FastAPI Startup Event Deprecation
The application was using the deprecated `@app.on_event("startup")` decorator which generates warnings in newer FastAPI versions:

```python
# Before (deprecated)
@app.on_event("startup")
def on_startup():
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

# After (modern approach)
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Startup
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
    yield
    # Shutdown (if needed)

app = FastAPI(title="CCGenTool2 API", lifespan=lifespan)
```

### 2. Docker Compose Configuration
- Removed obsolete `version: "3.9"` specification that generates warnings
- Added ca-certificates installation to Dockerfile to fix SSL certificate issues during pip install

### 3. Repository Cleanup
- Added comprehensive `.gitignore` file to exclude build artifacts, dependencies, and cache files
- Removed accidentally committed build files (`__pycache__`, `node_modules/.vite`, etc.)

## Testing Results

Comprehensive testing confirmed the application is fully functional:

### Backend (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Health monitoring endpoint with database connectivity check
- ✅ Complete CRUD operations for components management
- ✅ Proper CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- ✅ SQLAlchemy models and Pydantic schemas working correctly

### Frontend (Vue.js + Vite)
- ✅ Modern Vue 3 with Composition API
- ✅ Responsive design with professional dark theme
- ✅ Real-time database status monitoring in navbar
- ✅ Interactive data querying with search functionality
- ✅ Full CRUD interface for component management

### Integration Testing
- ✅ Seamless frontend-backend communication
- ✅ Real-time UI updates when data changes
- ✅ Debounced search with live filtering
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation

## Screenshots

The application features a clean, professional interface:
