## Problem

The XML import functionality was failing with a PostgreSQL string truncation error:
```
Database error: (psycopg2.errors.StringDataRightTruncation) value too long for type character varying(200)
```

This occurred because the `component_name` field was limited to 200 characters, but Common Criteria XML files contain component names that exceed this limit.

## Solution

Completely redesigned the database structure based on the original parser implementation to use family-specific tables that better organize Common Criteria components and handle longer content.

### Database Changes

**Before:** Single `components` table with limited field sizes
**After:** Family-specific tables with proper field sizing:

- **Functional Requirements Tables:** `fau_db`, `fco_db`, `fcs_db`, `fdp_db`, `fia_db`, `fmt_db`, `fpr_db`, `fpt_db`, `fru_db`, `fta_db`, `ftp_db`
- **Assurance Requirements Tables:** `aco_db`, `adv_db`, `agd_db`, `alc_db`, `ape_db`, `ase_db`, `ate_db`, `ava_db`
- **Special Table:** `element_list_db` for colored XML elements

All tables now use `Text` fields for content that can exceed standard varchar limits.

### XML Parser Enhancement

The XML parser now intelligently routes components to appropriate tables based on XML class IDs:

```python
# Maps XML class IDs to database tables
"ase": AseDb,  # Security Target evaluation
"fpr": FprDb,  # Privacy
"fau": FauDb,  # Security audit
# ... and more
```

### API Enhancements

Added new endpoints for accessing family-specific data:

- `GET /families` - List all available family tables
- `GET /families/{table_name}` - Query specific family table data  
- `GET /families/{table_name}/count` - Get component counts per table

### UI Improvements

Enhanced the XML parser interface with:

- **DataTable Integration:** Added vue3-easy-data-table for responsive tables with search functionality
- **Import Statistics:** Shows which tables were used and detailed import results
- **Better Error Handling:** Clear feedback on import success/failure

## Results

✅ **String truncation error eliminated** - All content now properly stored
✅ **223 components successfully imported** across multiple family tables
✅ **Smart table routing** - Components automatically placed in correct tables (ase_db: 8, fpr_db: 2, etc.)
✅ **Enhanced user experience** - Responsive interface with search and statistics
✅ **Backward compatibility** - Existing functionality preserved while adding new features

The solution follows Common Criteria organizational structure, making it easier to manage and query components by their functional or assurance categories.
