This PR addresses two critical usability issues in the database interface:

## ðŸŽ¨ Fixed Table Color Accessibility Issue

The query data tables had poor color contrast with alternating dark/light rows that made text difficult to read, especially where dark backgrounds blended with the font color. This created accessibility barriers for users.

**Changes made:**
- Removed the `alternating` property from EasyDataTable components
- Updated CSS variables to use clean white backgrounds with high contrast dark text
- Improved hover states with subtle light gray backgrounds

**Before:** Dark alternating rows with poor text visibility

**After:** Clean white backgrounds with excellent readability

## ðŸ”§ Implemented Table Selection for Modify Data Page

The modify data page was completely empty and only worked with the general `components` table, making it impossible to edit the family-specific tables that contain the actual imported XML data.

**Changes made:**
- Added a "Table Location" dropdown with all available database tables organized by category:
  - Functional Requirements (fau_db, fco_db, fcs_db, etc.)
  - Assurance Requirements (aco_db, adv_db, agd_db, etc.)
  - Special Tables (element_list_db)
  - General (components)
- Implemented full CRUD functionality for family-specific tables
- Added new backend endpoints for family table operations
- Dynamic loading of table data based on user selection

**Before:** Empty page with no functionality

**After:** Full table selection and CRUD functionality

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

**Frontend Updates:**
- `QueryData.vue`: Improved accessibility with white table backgrounds and high contrast text
- `ModifyData.vue`: Complete rewrite with table selection dropdown and support for family-specific tables

**Backend Updates:**
- Added `POST /families/{table_name}` for creating components in family tables
- Added `PUT /families/{table_name}/{item_id}` for updating family table components  
- Added `DELETE /families/{table_name}/{item_id}` for deleting family table components
- Proper error handling and validation for all new endpoints

## âœ… Testing Verified

All CRUD operations have been thoroughly tested:
- âœ… Create: Successfully adds new components to selected family tables
- âœ… Read: Properly loads and displays data from selected tables
- âœ… Update: Saves edits to existing components correctly
- âœ… Delete: Removes components from tables as expected
- âœ… Table Selection: Dropdown correctly loads data for all table types

The application now provides a complete, accessible interface for managing database components across all table types, with the imported XML data fully accessible for modification.
